# TalkingDog
A keyboard of arcade style buttons to teach a dog to talk with a raspberry PI and MCP23017 and ALSA
Basic Concept:
  buttons that are big enough and robust enough to have a dog press with a paw.
  When a button is pressed, an audio file is played through a USB speaker.
  Since the 'arcade' buttons also have LED's the hardware can also light them as a teaching aid.
  
Future type of things easily added:
  Dog can text you (ie whatever the dog keyboards will be sent as an email or text)!
  Dog can get a treat from pushing a button or you can doit via the web
  Raspi camera to see your at the keyboard?
  
Directories:
  doc/ -- Some drawings/docs in the doc directory.  Likly this will be hand built
  python/ -- the code
  sounds/ -- sound files for the buttons.
